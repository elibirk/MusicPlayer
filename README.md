# MusicPlayer
MusicPlayer is a simple Android application to download and play a specific song.

User simply downloads the song using the download button. The DownloadManager service downloads the song, then a BrodcastReceiver is used to notify the user of the completed download and update the app. Image, song title, and artist change upon download. Then the user may play, stop, and pause as desired using the respective buttons. 

Majority of application no longer functions due to Androidâ€™s security improvements. Images are not my own.
